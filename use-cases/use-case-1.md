# Use Case 1: Error identification and investigation

1. The user filters the discover view for all documents with log level 'error' 
   in a given time frame.
2. She identifies three lines originating from two distinct subsystems on two 
   servers that match these criteria.
3. First she would like to investigate the context for each line in regard to 
   the subsystem it originates from.
4. If the problem looks like it could be related to hard- or software problems 
   on one of the servers, she would like to investigate the context of each 
   line in respect to each server. (Note that neither the subsystem nor the 
   server were part of the initial filter.)
